# Sorting Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
> At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
